### Outline

This project is an online library book sharing website. The purpose of developing this website is to help users find and comment on books they want to read or like. Project functions include user registration, retrieval of books, user adding comments and like buttons.

### Target population

The target users of this website are book collectors or researchers who often use books.

### Data structure

The entire website framework development stack is roughly divided into front-end, back-end and database. The front-end uses [React](https://reactjs.org/) to complete the compilation, and the back-end writes code based on [Express](https://expressjs.com/), and the database used is [Mangodb](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html)

### About Github repository

For the use of Github repository, our team divides the data project into 5 different branches. The task items of each team member will be completed in their different project branches, which can effectively avoid data conflicts that may occur when team members submit data together. After the team members complete their task codes, make sure that they can be matched on the main branch if there is no error. Of course, the task of some team members is to manage all the code in the main, so they are approved to directly edit the code of the main branch.
